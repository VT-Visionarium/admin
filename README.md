miscellaneous installation scripts and system administration task notes

This replaces the now deprecated old repository
https://github.com/VT-Visionarium/garlic.git.  The old repository may have
information that you're looking for, but look here first.  If you find
what you're looking for in https://github.com/VT-Visionarium/garlic.git,
please refine it and move it to this repository.

Or better yet if you are my replacement, deprecate this repository and
make yet another github repository.  Using the Virginia Tech repository
servers is a bad idea, they do not have the long term goals that are
needed, that will make your access to your data easy for you and your
collaborators.  Their services will never be robust enough over the long
haul.

My research has evolved beyond the confines of Virginia Tech.  You may
find useful installation scripts and system administration task notes at
