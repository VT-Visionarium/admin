So far I have failed to build castle engine, but here are my notes so far.

Trying on Debian 9

castle engine uses Lazarus IDE (integrated development environment)



# apt-get install lazarus-ide  FAILS because it's too old (as of Aug 15 2019)


   get the deb files from:
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/lazarus/files/Lazarus%20Linux%20amd64%20DEB/Lazarus%202.0.4/

Run:

   gdebi fpc-laz_3.0.4-1_amd64.deb  
   gdebi fpc-src_3.0.4-2_amd64.deb 
   gdebi lazarus-project_2.0.4-0_amd64.deb

   ./install.bash
