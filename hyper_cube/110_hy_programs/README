This directory is used to keep the source for many programs that there
developed for the Virginia Tech HyperCube; it's just a CAVE (Cave
Automated Virtual Environment) with 8 high resolution projectors:
2560x1600 pixels.

Some programs are scripts and others are C/C++ code.

This directory is setup like a software project the gets installed by
running:

   ./bootstrap
   make
   make install SUDO_INSTALL=yes 

Running ./bootscrap will download file(s).  The sudo in the second make
is needed to install files in /etc/, most of the file copying does not
use root (sudo) access.  Running 'make install' without SUDO_INSTALL set
works too, but will not attempt to run an sudo command, and so will not
install files in /etc/.

We have no configure step between bootstrap and make.  The installation
PREFIX is set in config.make.

For the most part all this code is not intended to be usable by more than
one group of people: the Virginia Tech Visualization Group which is
currently part of ARC (Advanced Research Computing) in Blacksburg at
Virginia Tech.

Note: Some of the programs are dependent on programs in other directories.
