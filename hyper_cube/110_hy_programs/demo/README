On the cube computer run:

   make
   make install

The script hy_demoLauncher needs to be installed on a different
computer.   We run hy_demoLauncher to launch the demo launcher
web server on the cube.

The console programs are meant to run on a "remote console computer" (not
on the cube computer that runs the projectors) and can be installed in
/usr/local/encap/hy_console-VERS by running:

   cd console
   make
   make install
   cd -
