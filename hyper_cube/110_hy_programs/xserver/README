WM2 window manager takes the minimalist approach:
http://www.xwinman.org/wm2.php




edit /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config to include the line:
allowed_users=anybody

Gets rid of the error mesage:
/usr/lib/xorg/Xorg.wrap: Only console users are allowed to run the X server




Running X11 with startx leads to problems.  We do not want to use the
startx that come with XFCE.  startx tends to add user custom desktops
that will like all users have a different desktop.  If user wish to
do that we do not stop them, but hy_starts will make the same desktop
for any user that runs it.  Advanced users may run
XORGCONFIG=xorg.conf.hy_2560x1600 startx
to make their own desktop.




# Installed the very simple window manager wm2
apt install wm2

service lightdm stop
systemctl disable lightdm.service

cp -a  /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d.ORG

left only the following files in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
10-nvidia.conf  40-libinput.conf


Run:
./hy_start

In the X windows on the cube projector left wall run:
sudo nvidia-settings

We used this GUI program, nvidia-settings, to make the file
xorg.conf.hy_2560x1600.   We did not install it as
/etc/X11/xorg.conf, because that can let the 'startx' program
that installed with the system run X11 given a user configurable
desktop which works against what we need to do.  We need to
make a "CAVE" display that just displays CAVE programs, not
regular desktop programs.

# did
sudo cp xorg.conf.hy_2560x1600 xorg.conf.hy_1920x1200 /etc/X11/
