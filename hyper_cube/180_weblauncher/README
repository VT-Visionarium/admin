We installed and maintain a separate software package:

https://github.com/VT-Visionarium/webLauncher.git

ssh:git@github.com:VT-Visionarium/webLauncher.git


We also needed to do:

   chmod 666 /usr/local/encap/webLauncher/etc/key.pem

so that all users on the system can start the web service via
the "webLauncher" program which must be able to read that file.
