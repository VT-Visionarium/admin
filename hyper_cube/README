In this directory and its' subdirectories are the notes, code, and scripts
for setting up the Virginia Tech HyperCube (CAVE).

There are no secrets in these files.  I see no point in putting this data
in a secret, limited access, repository.  There is a big advantage to
keeping this data accessible to the general public.  Using a Virginia Tech
resource to keep this data will limit the access to this data by myself,
the author, because in the long term I don't necessarily control access to
this data.  I'd venture to say that my job will never be as stable as my
access to github.com, even though they got bought by MicroSoft.  I've
never lost any data on github in well over 10 years (today being: Jul 10,
2019).

The subdirectory names start with a number in NNN_ where N is a decimal
digit.  We try to keep the number order to be about the same as order in
which the information in the subdirectory would be accessed in
building/configuring a new hyper-cube computer, though this order may not
be strictly required.

Current operating system (OS) Ubuntu 18.04 desktop.  We will need the fast
desktop "gaming like" kernel toning for interactive responsiveness.  Not a
server kernel toning which may wait longer to respond to requires so that
it is more efficient.

We need to figure out if Gnone 3 and the wayland windowing system will act
well with the Open GL graphics applications, and the Nvidia graphics
drivers.  Currently (Jul 10, 2019) how it will preform is unknown.
